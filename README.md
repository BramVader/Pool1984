Pool1984
========

This project attempts to recreate the "Pixar 1984 pool ball shot", mentioned in the paper "Distributed
Ray Tracing" by Robert L. Cook, Thomas Porter and Loren Carpenter which can be found [here](https://graphics.pixar.com/library/DistributedRayTracing/). The principles described in this paper will be used to recreate the picture, 
which can be found at the end of the paper and also on the web page as a thumb nail. Ironically, the
[thumbnail](http://graphics.pixar.com/library/DistributedRayTracing/thumbNail.png), which in reality is an image of 778x669 pixels is the best quality we have.


will be continued...
